**Pain Points:**

- **Navigational Challenges:** Students, visitors, and staff often find it difficult to navigate the CIT campus due to the lack of a comprehensive and interactive map.
- **Inefficient Time Usage:** Without an easy way to locate buildings, individuals may waste time searching for their destinations, leading to delays and frustration.
- **Lack of Information Accessibility:** Important details about campus buildings and points of interest are not readily accessible in a centralized platform.
- **Orientation Difficulties:** New students and visitors may struggle with campus orientation, affecting their overall experience.

**Solution:**

The **CIT-U Campus Navigator** is a user-friendly web application designed to simplify navigation across the Cebu Institute of Technology campus. The solution incorporates:

- **Interactive Campus Map:** An online map providing a detailed representation of all campus buildings and key locations.
- **Informative Icons:** Visual markers on the map that offer relevant information about buildings and points of interest when interacted with.
- **Advanced Geolocation Features:** Integration of geolocation services to help users pinpoint their current location on campus for easier orientation.
- **Building Search Functionality:** A search feature allowing users to quickly find specific buildings by name.
- **Smooth and Intuitive Experience:** An emphasis on user interface and experience to ensure ease of use for all users.

The application is built using modern technologies such as **ReactJS**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL** to ensure a responsive and reliable performance. Future iterations plan to include features like **route planning**, **3D mapping**, and **offline functionality** to further enhance the user experience.
